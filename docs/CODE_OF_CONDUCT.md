# Contributor Code of Conduct

Our [company values](https://eu001-sp.shell.com/sites/AAFAA5088/Pages/sgbp.aspx) guide us in our day-to-day interactions and decision-making. Our inner source projects are no exception. Honesty, Integrity and Respect are core values we believe should live within our projects. Our community welcomes participants from around Shell with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* **Be friendly and patient**
* **Be welcoming** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be careful with the words you choose** We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * Discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Be Considerate** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
* **Focusing on what is best for the community**
* **Showing empathy towards other community members**

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers or community members.

## Reporting Guide

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct with instances of abusive,
harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior we ask that you report it to the
project team at (insert email). **All reports will be kept confidential**. If a
statement needs to be made public, the identities of all victims and reporters
will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. **If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first**.
If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where
it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it.
A report should include:

* Your contact information
* Names of any individuals involved (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) including any witnesses
* When and where the incident occurred
* Your account of what occurred
* Any extra content you believe existed for the incident
* If you believe the incident is ongoing
* Any additional relevant information

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
